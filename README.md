# HateDetector
A tool to monitor the number of anti-Semitic tweets on Twitter over a given period of time. 

This tool will consist of an .NET core API backend paired with a Blazor frontend. The API will pull tweets, perform analysis, populate data models, save results to Azure, and then serve the data to the frontend.
